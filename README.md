## Description
Introducing dnaMe, an innovative app empowering users to gain deeper insights into their health. Our platform enables users to upload raw DNA data sourced from providers like 23andMe and Ancestry for analysis of oneâ€™s genetic predisposition toward major diseases.

Modern genetic analysis companies offer limited insights into critical health risks, leaving users with a superficial understanding of their genetic predispositions. For instance, 23andMe's tests only cover 44 out of 4000+ variants in the BRCA1/2 tumor suppressor gene.

dnaMe revolutionizes this landscape by providing users with a comprehensive analysis of their specific disease risks. While we recognize the enormity of this task and understand that covering every disease is a monumental challenge, we are dedicated to starting with a focus on Alzheimer's disease risk analysis, driven by its personal significance to our founder.

Join us as we embark on a mission to redefine personal health insights through advanced DNA analysis. Together, let's unlock a deeper understanding of our genetic health profiles for a healthier tomorrow.
