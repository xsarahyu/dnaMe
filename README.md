# dnaMe üß¨üî¨ü•º

## Description
Introducing dnaMe, my passion project ‚Äî an innovative app empowering users to gain deeper insights into their health. The platform currently specializes in the analysis of genetic predisposition to Alzheimer's disease, allowing users to upload raw DNA data from providers like 23andMe and Ancestry for personalized risk assessments.

While dnaMe currently only performs risk analysis of Alzheimer's disease, my future plans, as evidenced by the app's landing page, include broadening the scope to cover a multitude of diseases. Stay tuned for exciting updates as I attempt to redefine healthcare through personalized DNA analysis! ü§ì

  Before delving into how dnaMe determines genetic predisposition, it's important to understand a few biology concepts.

  ### ‚úÇÔ∏è SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism)
  A SNP is a variation at a single position in the DNA sequence that occurs when a single nucleotide (A, T, C, or G) is replaced by another. SNPs influence traits, diseases, and responses to medications.

  ### üìñ rsID (Reference SNP IDentifier)
  An rsID is a unique identifier assigned to a specific SNP, aiding researchers in tracking genetic variations. For example, rs429358 and rs7412 are rsIDs for SNPs in the APOE gene.

  ### üß¨ Allele & Genotype
  An allele is a variant form of a gene; a genotype is the combination of two alleles (you inherit one allele from each parent). In the context of a SNP, the alleles refer to the nucleotides at the specific position. For example, in the SNP rs429358, the two alleles could be T&T, C&T, or C&C. Thus, the genotype is either TT, CT, or CC, respectively.

  ### üß¨ Apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene
  The APOE gene provides instructions for producing apolipoprotein E, a protein involved in lipid metabolism. Variations in the APOE gene, determined by SNPs rs429358 and rs7412, influence protein function and therefore risk of various health conditions, including Alzheimer's disease.

  In the APOE genotype, the Œµ4 allele is considered a risk factor for Alzheimer's, while Œµ2 is associated with lowered risk.

  ### APOE Genotypes and Alzheimer's Risk
  | rs429358 Genotype | rs7412 Genotype | APOE Genotype | Alzheimer's Risk         |
  |-------------------|------------------|-------------|---------------------------|
  | TT                | CC               | Œµ2/Œµ2       | Lower risk than normal    |
  | CT                | CT               | Œµ2/Œµ3       | Lower risk than normal    |
  | TT                | CC               | Œµ2/Œµ4       | Slightly higher risk      |
  | CC                | CC               | Œµ3/Œµ3       | Normal risk               |
  | CT                | CC               | Œµ3/Œµ4       | Higher risk than normal   |
  | CC                | CC               | Œµ4/Œµ4       | High risk                 |

  ### The App
  1. Given a raw DNA file, which contains hundreds of thousands of rsIDs, dnaMe extracts the genotypes of two SNPs, rs429358 and rs7412.
  2. The app uses this information to determine the alleles that make up one's APOE gene, which can be any combination of Œµ2, Œµ3, and Œµ4.
  3. Lastly, the app takes the APOE gene and determines the genetic predisposition to Alzheimer's disease.
